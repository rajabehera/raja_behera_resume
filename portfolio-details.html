                    <li><strong>Withdraw Earnings</strong>: The app allows users to withdraw their earnings seamlessly, with options to choose the withdrawal method that suits them best.</li>
                  </ul>

                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Design Process</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>User Research and Personas</strong>: Conducted user research to understand the needs and pain points of cab drivers and partners. Created personas to represent the target users, guiding the design decisions.
